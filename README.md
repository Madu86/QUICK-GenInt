CUDA code generator for molecular integrals found in *ab initio* and density functional theory calculations.  

Features
--------
* Generates device kernels for Coulomb attraction integrals, supports up to f basis functions.
* Integral formalism using Obara-Saika and Head-Gordon, Pople algorithms.

Limitations
-----------
* Only supports Cartesian basis functions at the moment.

Requirements
------------
* Python 3.9

Usage
-----

Before starting, make sure to go through Obara-Saika paper, which can be found [here](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.450106). To generate integral code, simply run GetInt.py with the python interpreter. This will generate 4 cuda header files in QUICK-GenInt/output folder. The first file (\*_classes.h) contains a set of integral class definitions. The second (\*_definitions.h), contains the constructor definitions of integral classes. The third and fourth (\*_assembler.h, \*_grad_assembler.h) are drivers for assembling true Coulomb integrals and their gradients using auxilary integral classes. Autogenerated code samples can be found in  QUICK-GenInt/samples folder.
